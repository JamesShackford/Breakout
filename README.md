Name: Jimmy Shackford (jas199)

Start/End/Time: Started Jan. 14, ended Jan. 23. --> worked for 50 hrs

Help: Used lab_bounce as a template, StackOverflow for general questions, and JavaFX documentation for JavaFX-specific questions.

Start project with: Game.java (in package named "game")

Test project with: PolarUtilTest (in package named "test") for difficult methods in PolarUtil. For the most part, I tested the code manually by playing the game.

Data/Resource files: images included in the images folder

Information about using: Cheat codes are:
	Numeric key (1-3) --> skip to that level
	'L' --> adds extra life
	'F' --> makes ball faster
	'S' --> makes ball slower
	'R' --> resets ball/paddle to initial position
	'E' --> adds extra ball to field

Known bugs, crashes, or problems: The bouncer does not bounce off the edge of a Brick according to the law of reflection--it takes a different path instead for some reason. Occasionally, a bouncer will travel through an unbreakable brick. When bouncer hits edge of 2-hit block, it will instantly destroy it.

Extra features: Made the paddle and entire stage behave with circular motion.
Press spacebar to begin the bouncer's motion. If spacebar is not pressed, the bouncer follows the paddle
I included 5 different power-ups instead of the required 3.
I included 5 different kinds of bricks instead of the required 3.
Splash screen has multiple pages so that user can scroll through the instructions
My different paddle abilities are:
1. When the player holds down left/right, the paddle's speed constantly increases until it reaches a threshold velocity.
2. When the player releases left/right key, the paddle slow's down.
3. Sticky paddle power up--balls stick to the paddle whenever the player gets this power up.
4. Paddle moves in circular motion.

Impressions to help improve: In my opinion, there wasn't much freedom of choice in this project. Everybody in the class is basically making the same project, and that made the project a little un-exciting for me. However, I did like that there was enough freedom that we could add our own elements to the game. Overall, it makes sense why the project was structured like it was--so that students wouldn't have to spend hours deciding what their game would be about, and we basically already had a starting point. I thought this was a very good project to begin with for these reasons, but it would be nice if the project were just a little bit less regimented.
